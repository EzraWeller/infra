# Infra
Infra contains [DAOstack](https://www.github.com/daostack)'s base layer components for decentralized governance such as voting machines and reputation system. 

Infra is the stack layer where we expect most governance innovation to happen. Rather than full DAO governance services, Infra provides generalized decision-making mechanisms for any use, DAO or otherwise.
